    <p>I was working in a team of 5 devs (3 backend and 2 frontend), 2 QA, one product designer and product manager. We were making product called Fleet.</p>
    <div>Fleet helps to control processes of taxi stations, such as collecting different reports about rides, working with drivers and other information connected with taxi stations</div>
    <p>We had classic SCRUM planning, two week sprints, regular Retro meetings every week, daily meetings and all in all were always been in touch. These measures helped us to be sure everybody knows in which direction the product is going and everybody could contribute to the product development. It was cool.</p>

    <p>Scrolling on main page change active poster</p>
    <p>Clicking on the poster seamlessly takes you to detailed page of project</p>
    <p>Posters were made in Adobe After Effects by designers. We were also testing their performance for a numerous number of times, trying to make them light as possible in terms of rendering</p>
    <p>On detailed pages you can find interactive grpahics in right top corner. It was made with p5 library and interacts with user actions on page such as scrolling or moving cursor</p>
    <p>As a framework we used Nuxt JS</p>

    <p>On this project I was leading frontend team of 5 devs</p>
    <p>We had really tiny amount of time to complete the project, which had to have not ordinary design with animations and at the same time product functions because they sell insurance products online</p>
    <p>I managed to allocate responsibilities in a proper way to finish the project despite lack of time</p>
    </p>We've created our own form builder to complete all pages with forms much quicker, which helped us to decrease amount of time for this part of website</p>
    <p>Also we optimized all animations we used through profiling and finding all bottle-neck places of code. For example, animations on cards were made with Lottie JS and all of them are controlled by user location on the page</p>
    <p>Card animations were made in Adobe After Effects by designers and implemented with Lottie JS. We were also testing their performance for a numerous number of times, trying to make them light as possible in terms of rendering</p>
    <p>Menu opening and closing animations were made with GSAP</p>
    <p>Website also has admin panel from which data is collected through REST API</p>
    <p>Nuxt JS was picked as framework</p>

    <p>Lots of animations mostly made with GSAP took a lot of time to optimize work on most devices</p>
    <p>Different pages of website have different types of design experiments, from dragging event cards to nonstop running texts, so it's really intersting just to surf through pages and try all of these features</p>

    <p>Outsource development of websites with creative interfaces</p>
  <p>Worked with creative interfaces. Came here to the position of Junior Frontend Developer and after 1.5 years I was leading a Frontend team of 5 devs. In these two years I took part in 5 projects</p>
  <p>Thanks to these time I gained a lot of experience in creating web animations, paying attention to website performance and working on optimization of the rendering process. Usually we had a really small amount of time to complete projects (as in any digital studio), so in this tempo I also upgraded my ability to complete tasks in a short time but not forgetting about quality of code. Strict deadlines forced me to gain expertise in new technologies fast and I was rather good at it.</p>
  <p>Duties:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Working with complicated animations using Vue JS (Nuxt JS was used where SSR was needed)</li>
    <li>Optimizing website performance in terms of rendering process</li>
    <li>Mentoring Junior Developers</li>
    <li>Working with forms</li>
    <li>Leading a Frontend team of 5 developers on the last project</li>
